/**
 * Shared parameter types used by both LegacyNoteGenerator and the
 * INoteGenerator interface. Extracted into its own header to break the
 * include cycle between Source/Inference/INoteGenerator.h and
 * Source/Utils/LegacyNoteGenerator.h.
 *
 * Method bodies (e.g. ScaleSnapConfig::semitones, snapMidi, applyToNotes)
 * live in Source/Utils/LegacyNoteGenerator.cpp.
 *
 * Design note: ScaleSnap is intentionally NOT a field of NoteGeneratorParams.
 * Note generation produces chromatic-quantized notes; scale snapping is a
 * separate AutoTune-correction concern, applied post-generation by
 * `ScaleSnapConfig::applyToNotes`. This keeps the two responsibilities
 * decoupled (per `import-note-generation` spec).
